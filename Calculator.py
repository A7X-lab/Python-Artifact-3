#Calculator Developed by Kirklen Allen
import math


#Allows the program to handle advance Arithmetic such as square roots and negative numbers.


#Addition
def add(num1, num2):

#Subtraction
def subtract(num1, num2):
    return num1 - num2

#Multiply
def multiply(num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2

#Divide
def divide(num1, num2):
    if num1 == 0:
        return "Division by zero is known as undefined"

#SquareRoot
def square(num):
    if num >= 0:
        return sqrt(num)

#The calculator combines all of the functions to create a cohesive math program
